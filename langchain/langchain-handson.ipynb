       "* 1 tsp ground coriander\n",

       "* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
       "* 1 inch ginger, grated\n",
       "* 1 tbsp tomato paste\n",
       "* 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained\n",
       "* 1 cup heavy cream\n",

       "\n",
       "**Instructions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with olive oil, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. \n",
       "2. **Cook the Chicken:** Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n",
       "3. **Make the Sauce:** In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute more.\n",
       "4. **Add the Tomatoes and Cream:** Add the diced tomatoes and water to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the heavy cream, butter, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens. \n",
       "5. **Combine Chicken and Sauce:** Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and coat with the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is flavorful. \n",
       "6. **Serve:** Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with basmati rice, naan bread, or roti.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tips:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* For a milder flavor, reduce the amount of chili powder.\n",
       "* You can use chicken breasts instead of thighs, but they may dry out more quickly.\n",
       "* Add a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce for a slightly sweeter flavor.\n",
       "* For a richer sauce, use full-fat coconut milk instead of heavy cream.\n",
       "* Feel free to experiment with different spices and herbs to customize your Butter Chicken.\n",
